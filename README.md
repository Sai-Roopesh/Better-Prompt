# Better Prompt Generator

The **Better Prompt Generator** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance user-generated prompts using Azure AI's GPT-4o-mini model. This extension communicates with a server hosted on Render, which leverages Azure AI Inference SDK to refine and improve the prompts.

## Features

- üìù Accepts user input in the form of text prompts
- üîÑ Sends the input to an Azure AI-powered server for enhancement
- üí° Displays the improved prompt directly in the extension interface
- üìã Provides the option to copy the improved prompt to the clipboard

## How It Works

1. User enters a prompt in the extension's popup
2. Extension sends the prompt to a server hosted on Render
3. Server processes the prompt using Azure AI's GPT-4o-mini model and returns an improved version
4. Extension displays the refined prompt, which can be copied with a single click

## Tech Stack

- **Server**: Node.js server with Express, hosted on Render
- **Azure AI**: Utilizes the GPT-4o-mini model via Azure AI Inference SDK
- **Environment Variables**: Uses dotenv for managing environment variables
